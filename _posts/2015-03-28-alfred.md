There are built-in [features](http://support.alfredapp.com/features) that include:

- File Search
- Web Search
- Calculator
- Dictionary
- Contacts
- Clipboard (history and snippets)
- System Commands (sleep, restart, lock, log out, etc.)
- Terminal and Shell (running scripts and commands)
- Music (controlling iTunes).

Additional functionality can be added using workflows. Users can create their own workflows or import workflows shared by others. There is a [community forum](http://www.alfredforum.com/) and community repository of workflows called [Packal](http://www.packal.org/).

## Workflows

Each [workflow](http://support.alfredapp.com/workflows) consists of objects connected together.

**Triggers** are used to activate workflows.  

*Keyboard Hotkey* is the most common.  
*Remote Trigger* allows to trigger action from a smartphone.  
*External Trigger* gets triggered by another application.  
*File Action* adds custom action in Alfred's file actions list.  
 
**Inputs**

*Keyword* is the command you have typed like open or find. It can have additional query.  
*File Filter* is used for searchning and filtering files.  
*Script filter* returns results of an custom script.

**Actions** include functionality to *Open File, Reveal in Finder, Launch App, Search Web, Open URL, Run Script*, etc.

**Outputs** are used to show results, some options are to *Show Notification*, *Copy to Clipboard*, *Run Script* and others.
